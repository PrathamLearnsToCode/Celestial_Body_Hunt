# Celestial_Body_Hunt
This repository contains some highly ambitious projects as a part of hunting for Celestial Bodies in the interstellar medium using sophisticated algorithms of Machine Learning and Neural Networks

Project Number 1: Pulsar_star_prediction: Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter. Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted,which treat the candidate data sets as binary classification problems. 


Project Number 2: The purpose of making this multiclass classification is to prove that the stars follows a certain graph in the celestial Space ,specifically called Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram or simply HR-Diagram so that we can classify stars of various spectral class namely (O,B,A,F,G,K,,M) by plotting its features based on that graph.
